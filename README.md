## Introduction ##

This repository contains code, style and markup examples, for checking syntax highlighters colouring in different editors.

In my opinion, syntax highlighting for any programming language should look the same for the same code elements.  Therefore, while working on version 1.4 of my [colour scheme/highlighting][perv] for the [Sublime Text][sute] editor, I realized that it displays code in various languages differently, even if the source code is structurally very similar.

As my knowledge of programming languages is limited, I published my work so far but I would like to support more languages, so there's more to come.
